Task:

Soil erosion detection

Here is one of the open problems in Quantum. Soil erosion is a really unwanted process that spoils huge areas of fertile land. Your task is to train model for erosion detection.

What do you have:

-Sentinel2 tile (T36UXV_20200406T083559_TCI_10m.jp2);

-Masks with soil erosion for this tile (masks directory);
