Task:
You have a dataset (internsh
ip_train.csv) that contains 53 anonymized features and a target column. Your task is to build model that predicts a target based on the proposed features. Please provide predictions for internship_hidden_test.csv file. Target metric is RMSE. The main goal is to provide github repository that contains

Jupyter notebook with analysis https://github.com/NikBabych/TestIntern/blob/main/test3/jupyter%20notebook%20with%20analysis.ipynb

file with model predictions  https://github.com/NikBabych/TestIntern/blob/main/test3/prediction_results.csv

code for modeling (Python 3) https://github.com/NikBabych/TestIntern/blob/main/test3/model.py
